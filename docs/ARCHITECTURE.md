## Technical Architecture Document: project-develop-a-project

**1. System Overview**

`project-develop-a-project` is a project management application designed for scalability, maintainability, and security.  The system adopts a microservices-ready architecture using a clean separation of concerns between the backend (FastAPI), frontend (React), and database (initially SQLite, with potential for PostgreSQL migration).  Design principles emphasize modularity, testability, and efficient data flow.  The application will leverage asynchronous communication where appropriate (e.g., for real-time notifications) and employ robust error handling and monitoring throughout.

**2. Folder Structure**

The proposed folder structure is a good starting point and will be largely adhered to.  However, as the application grows, we may introduce sub-folders within `routers` and `services` to better organize features and maintain modularity.  For example, a `users` subfolder might house user-related routers and services.  We will also add a dedicated `tests` directory for comprehensive unit and integration testing.

**3. Technology Stack**

The proposed stack is suitable for the MVP.  However, we need to plan for scalability.

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+), Uvicorn (ASGI server)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Database:** SQLite (for MVP), PostgreSQL (for production) with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Caching:** Redis (to be introduced post-MVP)
* **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka (for asynchronous tasks and notifications, to be introduced post-MVP)
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (for production deployment)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI


**4. Database Design**

* **Schema Design:** We'll use a relational database model (PostgreSQL in production) with tables for users, projects, tasks, milestones, files, team memberships, permissions, and potentially a separate table for time entries.
* **Entity Relationships:**  Relationships will be defined using foreign keys to link related entities (e.g., users to projects, projects to tasks).
* **Data Modeling Approach:**  We'll utilize SQLAlchemy's ORM for efficient database interaction.  Data validation will be handled using Pydantic schemas.
* **Migration Strategy:** Alembic will be used for database migrations to manage schema changes smoothly.

**5. API Design**

* **RESTful API Principles:** We will adhere to RESTful principles, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
* **Endpoint Organization:** Endpoints will be organized logically by resource (e.g., `/users`, `/projects`, `/tasks`).
* **Request/Response Patterns:**  JSON will be used for data exchange.  Responses will include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization.

**6. Security Architecture**

* **Authentication Strategy:** JWT-based authentication with secure key management.
* **Authorization Patterns:** RBAC using roles and permissions assigned to users and teams.
* **Data Protection Measures:** Input validation, output sanitization, data encryption at rest and in transit (HTTPS).
* **Security Best Practices:** Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. OWASP guidelines will be followed.

**7. Frontend Architecture**

* **Component Organization:** Component-based architecture with reusable components.
* **State Management Approach:**  Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing application state.
* **Routing Strategy:** React Router for client-side routing.
* **API Integration Patterns:**  Axios or similar library for making API calls.

**8. Integration Points**

* **External APIs:** GitHub API for integration with GitHub repositories.  Calendar APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook) for calendar integration.
* **Third-party Services:**  Potential integration with other project management tools or communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams).
* **Data Exchange Formats:** Primarily JSON.
* **Error Handling Strategies:**  Centralized error handling with clear error messages and logging.

**9. Development Workflow**

* **Local Development Setup:** Docker Compose for setting up a local development environment.
* **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests for backend services and components, integration tests for API endpoints and frontend interactions, end-to-end tests.  Test frameworks like pytest (backend) and React Testing Library (frontend).
* **Build and Deployment Process:**  CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.  Automated testing, building, and deployment to staging and production environments.
* **Environment Management:**  Environment variables for configuration management.  Docker for consistent environments across development, staging, and production.


**10. Scalability Considerations**

* **Performance Optimization:**  Database query optimization, caching strategies (Redis), efficient algorithms.
* **Caching Strategies:**  Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, project details) using Redis.
* **Load Balancing:**  Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of multiple backend instances.
* **Database Scaling:**  Migrate to a horizontally scalable database like PostgreSQL with read replicas.  Consider database sharding for extremely large datasets.  Optimize database queries and indexes.


**Timeline and Risk Mitigation:**

**Phase 1 (MVP - 3 months):** Focus on core features (project creation, task management, team collaboration, basic authentication).  Use SQLite for the database.  Manual deployment.  Risk:  Limited scalability and potential for performance bottlenecks. Mitigation:  Thorough testing and performance monitoring.

**Phase 2 (Scalability and Security - 2 months):** Migrate to PostgreSQL, implement caching (Redis), robust authentication and authorization, and CI/CD.  Introduce asynchronous tasks. Risk:  Complexity of migration and potential for integration issues. Mitigation:  Phased migration approach, comprehensive testing, and rollback plan.

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features and Integrations - 3 months):** Integrate with external APIs (GitHub, calendar), add advanced features (real-time notifications, reporting), and implement load balancing. Risk:  Dependency on external APIs and potential integration challenges. Mitigation:  Thorough API testing and fallback mechanisms.

**Phase 4 (Production Deployment and Monitoring - 1 month):** Deploy to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure) using Kubernetes.  Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting.  Risk:  Deployment complexity and potential for unforeseen issues. Mitigation:  Thorough testing in a staging environment, robust monitoring, and incident response plan.


This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable and maintainable project management application.  Continuous monitoring, performance testing, and iterative improvements will be crucial for ensuring the application meets its business objectives and remains robust and secure.
