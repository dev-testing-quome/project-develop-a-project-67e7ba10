# Deployment Guide - project-develop-a-project

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-develop-a-project," a project management application.  This guide assumes familiarity with command-line interfaces, Docker, and at least one cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  Adapt commands and configurations to your specific chosen services and infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

**Required software and tools:**

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Git
* A cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, or Azure - choose one)
* A text editor or IDE
* (Optional, but recommended) Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) if using Kubernetes for orchestration.


**System requirements:**

* A server or cloud instance with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage) depending on expected load.  Minimum specifications will vary depending on the application's scale.  Start with at least 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, and 20GB storage.
* Network connectivity for communication between services.


**Account setup:**

* Create accounts on your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
* Create a project or resource group within your cloud provider account.
* Set up appropriate billing and access controls.


## Environment Setup

**Environment variables configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables (replace with your actual values):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db-host:5432/database_name
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
# ... other environment variables ...
```

**Database setup:**

* Create a PostgreSQL database instance (or your chosen database) on your cloud provider or locally.
* Ensure the database user has appropriate permissions.
* Populate the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable accordingly.

**External service configuration:**

* Configure any external services (e.g., email provider, payment gateway) and update the relevant environment variables in the `.env` file.


## Docker Deployment

**Building the Docker image:**

Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t project-develop-a-project .
```

**Running with docker-compose:**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file (example):

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: project-develop-a-project
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment_file: .env
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database_name
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Environment configuration:**

The `.env` file handles environment-specific configurations.  Different `.env` files can be used for development, staging, and production.

**Health checks and monitoring:**

Implement health checks within your application to verify its operational status.  Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor application metrics and logs.


## Production Deployment

**Cloud deployment options:**

* **AWS:** Use Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deployment.
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service.

**Container orchestration:**

* **Kubernetes:** Deploy your Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` commands.  Use deployments, services, and ingress controllers for managing and exposing your application.
* **Docker Swarm:**  Less commonly used for large-scale deployments, but can be used for simpler setups.

**Load balancing and scaling:**

Configure a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing, GCP Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Implement autoscaling based on resource utilization.


**SSL/TLS configuration:**

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt) and configure it with your load balancer or reverse proxy.


## Database Setup

**Database migration commands:**

Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.  Run migrations before deployment:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Initial data setup:**

Populate the database with initial data using scripts or fixtures.

**Backup and recovery procedures:**

Regularly back up your database.  Implement a recovery procedure to restore the database from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

**Application monitoring setup:**

Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic) to track application performance metrics (CPU, memory, request latency, error rates).

**Log aggregation:**

Collect logs from different components of your application using a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (ELK stack), Graylog).

**Performance monitoring:**

Monitor response times, throughput, and resource usage to identify performance bottlenecks.  Use profiling tools to analyze code performance.

**Error tracking:**

Integrate an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

**Common deployment issues:**

* **Network connectivity problems:** Check network configurations and firewall rules.
* **Database connection errors:** Verify database credentials and connection settings.
* **Application errors:** Examine application logs for error messages.


**Debug commands:**

* Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view container logs.
* Use debugging tools (e.g., pdb, gdb) to debug your application code.

**Log locations:**

Log files will typically be located within the container's file system, depending on your application's logging configuration.

**Recovery procedures:**

* Restore from backups (database and application state).
* Roll back to a previous deployment version.


## Security Considerations

**Environment variable security:**

Do not hardcode sensitive information in your code.  Use environment variables and secure ways to manage them (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

**Network security:**

Implement appropriate network security measures, including firewalls, access control lists, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

**Authentication setup:**

Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) to secure access to your application.

**Regular security updates:**

Keep your application and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.


This guide provides a framework.  You'll need to tailor it to your specific project requirements and chosen technologies.  Remember to thoroughly test your deployment process before deploying to production.
