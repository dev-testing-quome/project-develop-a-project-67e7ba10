## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-develop-a-project
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Backend (from backend directory)
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Frontend (from frontend directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation at:

* **API Documentation (Swagger UI):** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Alternative API Docs (ReDoc):** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/projects`:  GET (retrieve all projects), POST (create a new project)
* `/projects/{project_id}/tasks`: GET (retrieve tasks for a specific project), POST (create a new task)
* `/users`:  GET (retrieve all users), POST (create a new user)  *(Authentication required)*
* `/auth/login`: POST (user login)


**Sample Request (creating a new project):**

```json
POST /projects
{
  "name": "My New Project",
  "description": "A sample project"
}
```

**Common Workflows:**

1.  **User Authentication:** Users log in using the `/auth/login` endpoint.
2.  **Project Creation:**  Create a new project via the `/projects` endpoint.
3.  **Task Assignment:** Assign tasks to team members using the `/projects/{project_id}/tasks` endpoint.
4.  **Progress Tracking:** Monitor task progress through the UI or API.
